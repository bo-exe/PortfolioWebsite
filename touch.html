        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Brief Summary: </span></p>
        <p>TOUCH community services is a non-profit organisation in Singapore that was registered in 1992.</p>
        <p>This app was created to allow users to easily look for upcoming or ongoing TOUCH community services and events.</p>
        <p>Users can use the app to sign-up or stay updated without having to search for TOUCH's website all the time.</p>
        <p>With this app, users can turn on push notifications which will allow them to get notified when there are upcoming events or when events begin.</p>
        <p>The app also allows user to log in using their Singpass which helps with efficiency.</p>
        <p>Kinesthetic and Haptic functions were also used in the creation of this app.</p>
        <p>Kinesthetic functions were used to track progress of users for certain events/workshops that may require users to move around or hit daily goals (Step goals etc.)</p>
        <p>Haptic functions were used to notify users when there are new notifications on upcoming or ongoing events (Phone vibrates when there are new notifcations)</p>
        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Key Demographic: </span></p>
        <p>The app can be used by audiences of any age. However, it is mainly focussed on accessibility for the elderly.</p>
        <p>The target audience would mainly be Singaporeans as TOUCH community services is a Singapore-based organisation that mainly organises events in Singapore.</p>
        <p>The app allows the elderly to stay engaged in the community and participate in local events and workshops, which may help the elderly enhance their social connections.</p>
        <p>By creating an app, it will also help the elderly to embrace technology and leverage its benefits to improve their community involvement.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Typography: </span></p>
        <p>Arial - Narrow</p>
        <p>Arial - Narrow Bold</p>
        <p>Arial - Bold Italic</p>
        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Color Scheme: </span></p>
        <p>Analogous.</p>
        <p>Touch uses mainly red and white in their designs so I decided to use colours ranging from orange to red.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #FF7474;">#FF7474</span> and <span style="color: #FFA700;">#FFA700</span> was used to create a gradient for the app's background.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #FFFA7E;">#FFFA7E</span> was used for the buttons on the app and it was also used as a stroke color for ovals to outline sections for the guided tour.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #FF9300;">#FF9300</span> was used for settings, support, donations, and events buttons.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #FF4343;">#FF4343</span> was used for the "Extract information from Singpass" buttons.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #FFB560;">#FFB560</span> was used for the field boxes in forms.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">#FFFFFF</span> was used for the background for certain images and text box fill for guided tour texts.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">#000000</span> was used as a text color.</p>
