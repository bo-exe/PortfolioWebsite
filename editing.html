        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Brief Summary: </span></p>
        <p>During my holidays, I worked with a Profession E-Sports athelete who competed in one of the biggest global stages in one of the biggest games in the world.</p>
        <p>The game is called VALORANT and the biggest tournament she participated in was the VALORANT Champions Tour 2022: Game Changers Championship. </p>
        <p>I was given the opportunity to edit youtube videos for her as she wanted to push out som content on her youtube channel in order to grow her audience and reach.</p>
        <p>During this time, I would take raw footages of streams that she would have live on her channel twitch.tv/sonder and cut them down into long form videos of around 8 minutes to 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>The most popular video of hers that was edited by me was a video titled "The WORST game of VALORANT I have ever played...".</p>
        <p>The video reached 50,000 views in the first 12 days of upload.</p>
        <p>As of the time of writing this, the video is sitting at 68,269 views.</p>
        <p>Everything from reviewing footage, cutting out and merging parts of the videos, to the thumbnails and descriptions were all done by me using opinions, feedbacks, and my own creativity.</p>
        <p>This was one of my proudest projects ever as I felt like during this time, I have learnt a lot about video editing and I was also extremely proud of how the videos came out.</p>
