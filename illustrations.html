        <p>This project was one of the first few projects I did on photoshop and it was created as a way for me to learn and practice few functions of Adobe Photoshop.</p>
        <p>The process for doing this project was quite simple.</p>
        <p>First, I took an image of a castle and another separate image of iceberg so I can crop and overlay them.</p>
        <p>I started off by simply choosing an area where I want to overlay the iceberg over and place the castle in.</p>
        <p>After that, I cropped out a part of the iceberg in order to make space for the castle and layer the cropped out iceberg over the castle.</p>
        <p>Then, I duplicated the castle layer, mirrored it, added a filter and lowered the opacity in order to make the reflection of the castle on the water.</p>
        <p>I also used the paint tool to add shadows around certain edges of the iceberg and castle to make it look more realistic.</p>

        <p>Just like the previous project, this project was one of the first few projects I did on illustrator and it was created as a way for me to learn and practice few functions of Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        <p>The main idea of this piece was to create a piece of art to inspire and educate the audience about Covid-19 prevention.</p>
        <p>Before I started working on the art of this project, I took some time to brainstorm on what I wanted the final work to look like.</p>
        <p>Since it was about fighting Covid-19, I was inspired by the concept of a game 'Street Fighter'.</p>
        <p>With that idea in mind, I designed a health bar inspired by the game and created a sanitizer bottle character to fight against the Covid-19 Virus.</p>
        <p>As for the background, I took inspiration from the shophouses and streets of Singapore.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Brief Summary: </span></p>
        <p>The idea of this project was to create a logo for a website I was developing called Game.GG.</p>
        <p>The website is a site that allows gamers and those interested in gaming related news to stay up-to-date</p>
        <p>To create the logo, I went to Adobe illustrator to create a globe as I felt like a globe would best represent the global reach the site has.</p>
        <p>The globe is also a way to represent that news provided on the site can cater to people all over the world.</p>
        <p>Then, I took the globe and went to photoshop and added the texts GAME GG around the globe.</p>
        <p>To add on, I created a gradient from bright red to neon green as I felt that those color give off the Futuristic feels to audiences.</p>
        <p>The futuristic colors helps to emphasize the point that Game.GG stays up-to-date.</p>

        <p>This project was created as using the transform wrapping function of Photoshop.</p>
        <p>To create this project, I decided to make use of the texts "Hello I am Boyang" with an image of a hobby of mine, volleyball.</p>
        <p>What I did was use the line "Hello I am", duplicated multiple times and wrapped to make the outline of a volleyball.</p>
        <p>Then, I used my name to transform and wrap to fill up the empty gaps in the ball to complete the volleyball.</p>
        <p>Overall, I thought that this project was interesting and I had learnt a lot from this.</p>

        <p>For this project, I had planned to design a name card for a coffe and tea brewing company I had created called "Brewed With Love".</p>
        <p>I created the card following a nature theme by using shades of green and by adding branches of leaves on the corners of the card.</p>
        <p>I also added the tagline "The Best For You." At the bottom of the card in the front together with the logo I created for the company.</p>
        <p>On the back of the name card, I added a few ways people who are interested in the company can contact me by.</p>
        <p>These incldue email, phone, and a website link.</p>
        <p>I also added my name and my position in the company for informational purposes.</p>
        <p>The entire project was done on Adobe Illustrator and I am extremely proud of how it turned out.</p>
