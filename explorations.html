        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Brief Summary: </span></p>
        <p>This project was created as a way for me to practice posing and lighting using blender.</p>
        <p>For this project, I had used a pre-made blender pack of character models from a game called VALORANT.</p>
        <p>Using the pack, I played around with the model, shifiting and rotating certain bones of the model to create a pose that I liked.</p>
        <p>Eventhough the process was tougher at the beginning, I eventually got the hang of it and I decided to add a few point lights to make certain parts glow.</p>
        <p>I also decided that I would export the model and use Photoshop to add details such as a red-ish background.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, I added a few point lights such as red lights behind the character to make it seem light the light is being emitted by the background.</p>
        <p>From there, I exported the model and added the background, smoke effects, texts that says the character's name (Jett) in both English and Korean.</p>
        <p>In order to include more aspects of the game that inspired this project into the final work, I added 4 icons which are icons of the character's abilities in the game.</p>

        <p>Just like the Render - Jett Project, this project was another way for me to learn to pose using Blender.</p>
        <p>Using a different character model from the same model pack, I played around and looked for an ideal pose with the end result including the background and details in mind.</p>
        <p>Since I had done this after the Render - Jett projext, I was more used to certain stuff and it did not take as long as it did with the first project.</p>
        <p>For this character, the two colors that I felt represented the character well that really stoof out for me were yellow and purple and thus I decided to focus on those colors.</p>
        <p>I knew I wanted the character's name to be behind the character and I thought it would be a great idea to do a half and half design using yellow and purple texts.</p>
        <p>Thus, I had used a yellow point light on the left and a purple point light on the right to make it seem like the texts are emitting light.</p>
        <p>After exporting the render and going to photoshop, I looked for a background image that fits the theme. I then added the texts with half and half design as I planned.</p>
        <p>I added some duplicated texts and overlayed them with lower opacity to give the text appear more 3D.</p>
        <p>I also cut the next of the character's name in half and added them to the top and the bottom with lines on the sides to create a border around the main subject.</p>

        <p>For this project, my main goal was to find ways to make little objects related to the main subject appear more natural using posing.</p>
        <p>The start of this project was the same as every other projects.</p>
        <p>I used a character model and played around with poses to find an ideal pose before importing models of extra content such as the knife, poison and grenade.</p>
        <p>Using blender, I positioned the different models of character abilities in a way I thought would look more realistic.</p>
        <p>Since I wanted the grenade to look like it was thrown upwards by the main character and the knife and poison to look like they were thrown from behind the character, I had made the grenade closer to the camera.</p>
        <p>Since I wanted to grenade to emit smoke, I decided to pull the pin out of the model to look like the pin had been removed and the grenade is in effect.</p>
        <p>I also added white point lights behind the character as I knew I would habe white texts and designs behind the character and I wanted it to look like the texts were emiting light.</p>
        <p>I also added lights of various colors based on the different objects such as orange for the grenade, and green for the poison to make them stand out a little more.</p>
        <p>Then, the process is the same in photoshop where I added texts and extra designs. I also added smoke effects and trails to the abilities to make them look more realistic.</p>
