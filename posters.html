        <p>For this project, the idea was to create a poster based on one word.</p>
        <p>In this case, I chose the word Dopamine.</p>
        <p>I used an image of a girl looking happy on a swing to represent the effects of dopamine to a person.</p>
        <p>In order to make the word stand out from the image, I made duplicates of the word "DOPAMINE" and overlapped them to create a 3D effect.</p>
        <p>Initially, there was only white texts but I felt that by having the middle text be of a different color, the texts will stand out more and be eye-catching.</p>
        <p>Thus, I gave the text a shade of red as red is pretty bright and can help to make the text even more eye catching.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">#FFFFFF</span> was used to complement with <span style="color: #FF4343;">#FF4343</span> to create the texts 'DOPAMINE'.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Brief Summary: </span></p>
        <p>For this project, the idea was to create a poster inspired by an artist or music festival.</p>
        <p>With the opportunity to explore my options, I decided to choose a music festival that features a few of my favourite artists, Head in the Clouds.</p>
        <p>I had used images of some of the artists that were featured in the festival as fans that see their favourite artists in the poster may be intrigued and want to find out more.</p>
        <p>I also generated a QR code that when scanned, will link users to the website with all the information about the festival for those that may want to find out more.</p>
        <p>To add on, I added the logo of the festival so when people look at the poster, in one glance, they can tell what the poster is for.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Color Scheme: </span></p>
        <p>Contrasting.</p>
        <p>I had used orange outlines with white texts as they contrast with each other and make the texts and images stand out.</p>
        <p>To create more contrast, I had used an image of the sky with the orange cloud caused by the sun to contrast with the images of the artists</p>
        <p>(As the images of the artists appear brighter)</p>

        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Brief Summary: </span></p>
        <p>The main concept of this project was to create a simple poster for myself.</p>
        <p>I decided to not only make it about myself but also about a fake company idea I made up.</p>
        <p>Prior to this, I had created an idea for a company that specialises tea and coffee called "Brewed With Love"</p>
        <p>Included in the poster is an image of me, the company logo, and a few lines to describe the drinks.</p>
        <p>I had used Adobe Illustrator to create the drawings of the coffe beans and tea leaves, and the logo for the company. 
        <p>Then, I made use of photoshop to create everything else and put them together.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Tools used: </span></p>
        <p>Adobe - Photoshop</p>
        <p>Adobe - Illustrator</p>
        <p><span style="color: #13EDA2;">Color Scheme: </span></p>
        <p>Tetradic and Analogous.</p>
        <p>I decided to use a tetradic color scheme as I felt like by adding more colors, the poster will be more eye catching.</p>
        <p>To add on, I used pastel colors as that will make the poster appear more approachable and make it look more "friendly".</p>
        <p>For the main logo at the middle, I used an Analogous color scheme as it will blend well together and look like they belong with each other. 
        <p>I used a shade that is more towards the red side as it represents the word "LOVE" really well.</p>
